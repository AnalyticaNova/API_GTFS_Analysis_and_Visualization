Transit Network SQL Analysis â€“ Summary of Findings
==================================================

This report highlights key findings from exploratory SQL analysis using GTFS transit data.
The analysis is grouped into three core themes: transit traffic volume, temporal service patterns, and accessibility equity â€” mirroring the structure used in the Tableau visualizations.

--------------------------------------------------
1- Transit Traffic: Where Are We Busy?
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Q1.1 â€“ Top 10 Busiest Stops:
We identified the stops with the highest number of scheduled departures.
Top 3 busiest stops:
- Station Lionel-Groulx
- Station Henri-Bourassa
- Angrignon / Tours Angrignon

ðŸ”¹ Q1.2 â€“ Which Routes Serve the Top 5 Stops Most?

Each of the top stops is served by multiple routes. For example:
- Angrignon / Tours Angrignon is served by: Newman, Jolicoeur, Monk, Centrale, Dorval/Angrignon
- Station Lionel-Groulx is served by metro lines: Ligne 1 - Verte and Ligne 2 - Orange

--------------------------------------------------
2 - Temporal Dynamics: When Do Riders Move?
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Q2.2 â€“ Hourly Departure Patterns by Weekday vs. Weekend:
We compared weekday and weekend departures hour by hour.

***Key Takeaways:
- Service begins as early as 4â€“5 AM and peaks between 6:00â€“9:00 and 16:00â€“18:00.
- Weekday service volume consistently exceeds weekend service (55% vs 45%).
- After midnight (hours > 24), service drops significantly.

--------------------------------------------------
3 - Accessibility: Are High-Traffic Areas Equitably Served?
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Q3.1 â€“ Which High-Traffic Stops Lack Accessibility?
We identified the top 10 busiest stops with no recorded wheelchair access (wheelchair_boarding = 2):
Examples include:
- Station De La Savane
- Station CÃ´te-Sainte-Catherine
- Station Laurier
- Station Jarry
- Station Beaubien

These stops should be prioritized for accessibility audits or upgrades.

ðŸ”¹ Q3.2 â€“ Whatâ€™s the Accessibility Rate Per Route?
We calculated the percentage of departures that are wheelchair accessible on each route.

- Most bus routes show 100% accessibility.
- Ligne 2 - Orange (metro): Only 54% of departures are marked as accessible â€” highlighting a gap in access on one of the busiest lines.

--------------------------------------------------
âœ… Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------

This SQL-based exploration allowed us to:
- Quantify demand at specific stops
- Analyze when the service is busiest
- Uncover accessibility mismatches between ridership and infrastructure

These insights complement visual Tableau dashboards and forecasting models developed in this project.
