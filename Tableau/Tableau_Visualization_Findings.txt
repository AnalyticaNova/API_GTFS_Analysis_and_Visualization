Montreal Transit Dashboard Analysis â€“ Tableau Findings
======================================================

This report presents key insights from Tableau visualizations built using GTFS transit data for Montreal.
The analysis is grouped into three themes: transit activity volume, rider behavior across time, and accessibility of the network.

The findings were derived from four interactive dashboards in Tableau Public (as part of the final story). These visualizations complement the SQL analysis and Python-based preprocessing.

--------------------------------------------------
1 - Where Are We Busy?
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ We identified major transit hubs with the highest departure activity.

Top 3 busiest stops:
- Station Lionel-Groulx
- Station Henri-Bourassa
- Angrignon / Tours Angrignon

These are critical transfer points between bus and metro lines, handling thousands of daily departures.

--------------------------------------------------
2 - When Do Riders Move?
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Peak hours were clearly identified:

- Morning Rush: 6:00 AM â€“ 9:00 AM
- Evening Rush: 4:00 PM â€“ 6:00 PM

** Service drops sharply after midnight. Hours beyond 24 represent overnight services.

** Weekday vs Weekend Service:
- Weekdays: 55% of total departures
- Weekends: 45%

--------------------------------------------------
3 - How Accessible Is the Network?
--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Several high-traffic stops lack confirmed wheelchair access.

Examples include:
- Station De La Savane
- Station CÃ´te-Sainte-Catherine

These stops were revealed by scatterplot analysis as high-demand yet inaccessible â€” candidates for accessibility upgrades.

--------------------------------------------------
âœ… Final Notes
--------------------------------------------------

These Tableau dashboards were built for intuitive exploration, combining map views, line charts, heatmaps, and accessibility overlays.

All preprocessing was completed in Python, including schedule enrichment, hourly grouping, and filtering top stops.

The visuals align directly with the SQL queries and Python forecasting models for a full-stack transit analysis.
